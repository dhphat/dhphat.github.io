Katy Perry was left dangling above fans' heads when a floating platform malfunctioned on her world tour.<br /><br />
The star had just performed Thinking Of You, perched several storeys above the audience on a model of Saturn.<br /><br />
But the prop refused to return to the stage, leaving the star stranded.<br /><br />
"This is the first time I've been stuck in space," she joked.<br /><br />
"I know I'm kind of a space cadet but actually, this thing is stuck."<br /><br />
"What should I do? Should I tell some jokes, should I tell some stories, should I just sing another song?"<br /><br />

	The star, who is one month into her Witness World Tour, was playing Nashville's Bridgewater Arena when the malfunction took place.<br /><br />
As stage hands tried to work out how to rescue her, Perry told fans: "You'd better put your phones up, it's a YouTube moment!"<br /><br />
In video posted on Twitter, the star added that she was getting constant updates from "the voice of God in my ear".<br /><br />
"I'm not talking about the voices in my head, they're just people," she laughed.<br /><br />

	After about two minutes, the singer was lowered manually to the ground, but could not get all the way down without crushing the audience.<br /><br />
Instead, she dived into the crowd and walked back to the stage.<br /><br />
"I guess I'm just going to have to get down and walk amongst my people. I love this so much, This is what you get for trying to bring out all of space to Nashville.<br /><br />	
	Perry has become known for her elaborate stage shows, and the Witness tour features several moveable platforms, larger-than-life mannequins and a pneumatic hand that grasps the star and pulls her beneath the stage, "Left shark" - her famously un-coordinated dancer from the 2015 Super Bowl - also makes a cameo.<br /><br />
The first seven shows of the Witness tour were postponed due to "production issues" but subsequent dates have proceeded without a hitch.<br /><br />
The UK leg of the tour takes place next June, with dates scheduled in London, Birmingham, Sheffield, Liverpool, Manchester, Glasgow and Newcastle.<br /><br />
